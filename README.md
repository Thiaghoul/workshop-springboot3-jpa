# PayMoreGetLess 🛒

**PayMoreGetLess** is a simple full stack e-commerce application built as a personal learning project. It includes basic e-commerce features and showcases the integration between a modern front-end and a secure back-end.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Front-end:** Angular  
- **Back-end:** Spring Boot  
- **Authentication & Security:** Spring Security with JWT  
- **Database:** H2  
- **Build Tools:** Maven, Angular CLI  

## 📌 Main Features

- User registration and login  
- JWT-based authentication and role-based access  
- Product listing  
- Shopping cart  
- Order placement  
- Address management  

## 💡 What I Learned

This project was my **first experience working with Angular** and front-end development in general. It helped me understand how the front-end communicates with the back-end through HTTP requests and how to manage application state on the client side.

On the back-end, I deepened my understanding of **Spring Security**, especially in implementing JWT for secure authentication and authorization.

## 🚀 Goals

- Build a fully functional full-stack app from scratch  
- Learn front-end development with Angular  
- Understand and implement secure authentication mechanisms  
- Practice RESTful API design and database modeling

## 📣 Final Thoughts

This has been the most rewarding project I’ve built so far. It was challenging, especially diving into front-end development for the first time, but it gave me a much clearer view of full stack application architecture.
